## 2026-01-04: System Initialization

### Knowledge Graph Status
- **Nodes**: 296 (230 papers, 33 methods, 33 concepts)
- **Edges**: 217+ relationships
- **Classic Papers**: 21 ingested (Watson-Crick, Turing, McCulloch-Pitts, GraphRAG, etc.)

### Key Cross-Domain Bridges Discovered

1. **UNI → 32 concepts**
   - Bridges: spatial transcriptomics, foundation model, morphogenesis, information theory
   - Implication: UNI is the universal connector in this corpus

2. **reaction-diffusion → pattern formation → spatial transcriptomics**
   - Classic Turing math could explain tumor microenvironment patterns
   - **Hypothesis**: Reaction-diffusion dynamics in TME explain Visium HD spatial patterns

3. **neural network → feedback loop → robustness**
   - McCulloch-Pitts → modern deep learning → systems biology
   - **Insight**: Classic neural networks share principles with gene regulatory networks

4. **GraphRAG → retrieval → reasoning**
   - Modern paper on combining graphs with LLMs
   - **Application**: Could enhance our polymathic discovery system

### Unexplored Combinations (Research Gaps)

| Method | Concept | Potential |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Prov-GigaPath | spatial deconvolution | HIGH - Your best encoder not yet tested on deconvolution |
| reaction-diffusion | foundation model | MEDIUM - Classic math + modern AI |
| network motif | gene expression | MEDIUM - Milo's patterns in scRNA-seq |
| GraphRAG | spatial transcriptomics | HIGH - Graph-based retrieval for ST papers |

### Hypotheses Generated

**H1: Foundation Model + Spatial Deconvolution (EV: 8.5)**
- Claim: Prov-GigaPath embeddings improve Cell2location by 15-25%
- Test: Replace encoder, train on P1/P2/P5
- Kill-shot: If improvement <10%, not worth complexity

**H2: Reaction-Diffusion for TME (EV: 7.0)**
- Claim: Turing patterns explain spatial gene expression gradients
- Test: Fit RD model to Visium HD spatial patterns
- Kill-shot: If fit R² < 0.5, mechanism unlikely

**H3: GraphRAG for Literature (EV: 8.0)**
- Claim: GraphRAG can discover cross-domain papers 3x better than keyword search
- Test: Compare discovery rate on known polymathic papers
- Kill-shot: If precision <50%, overhead not justified

## Insights to Remember

1. **Classic papers are gold** - Turing 1952 is still cited because the math is timeless
2. **Cross-domain = breakthroughs** - Every major discovery imports ideas from another field
3. **Graph first, then RAG** - KG gives structure, RAG gives context
4. **Unexplored ≠ impossible** - Just means nobody tried yet

## Questions for Future Sessions

1. Why is Virchow2 underrepresented in the corpus vs UNI?
2. Are there patents/industry papers we're missing?
3. Should we add citation network (OpenAlex)?
4. How to handle conflicting claims between papers?
